## Hi there from Costa Rica ðŸ‘‹

My name is Erick GuillÃ©n, I'm a Senior IT Manager that loves coding.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on serverless applications mainly in [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/).

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Microservices](https://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html) applications with minimalist Web Frameworks. 

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on [Powershell](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell) and any intersting application that caughts my attention.

ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with getting into open source projects.
